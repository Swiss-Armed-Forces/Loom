## Guidelines for Design Discussions

To maintain transparency and traceability:

- **Do not hold important design discussions in Rocket.Chat.**
  Always use **issues** or **merge request comments** to discuss design and technical decisions.This ensures all discussions
  are visible, well-documented, and accessible to the entire team.

## Development Workflow and Merge Requests

1. **Start with an Issue**
   - Always create an issue first to describe the problem, feature, or enhancement you wish to address.
   This ensures alignmentand facilitates discussion before implementation.
   - Use GitLabâ€™s **"Create Merge Request"** button directly from the issue.
   This automatically links the issue to the merge request and generates a branch with a default name.

2. **Branch Naming**
   - If a branch is generated from an issue using the **"Create Merge Request"** button, use the default branch name.
   - If you manually create a branch, use descriptive names prefixed with `feature/` or `bugfix/`, e.g., `feature/add-user-authentication`.

3. **Open Merge Requests Early**
   - Open your merge request (MR) as early as possible, even if no code has been written yet.
   An empty MR serves as a platform for early discussions and feedback.

4. **Draft Merge Requests**
   - All new MRs should initially be marked as **Draft**.
   This indicates that the MR is a work in progress and not yet ready for merging.
   - The **Draft** status should only be removed when the assignee deems the MR ready for merging.
   - While in Draft status, MRs do not require reviews and can generally be ignored by reviewers
   unless the assignee specifically requests a review.

5. **Use Meaningful Titles and Descriptions**
   - Use a clear and meaningful title for your MR. This title will be used to generate release notes,
   so ensure it accurately reflects the purpose of the MR.
   - Keep the MR description up-to-date with the scope and context of your work.
   Use it to explain implementation details or specific considerations.

6. **Linking Issues to Merge Requests**
   - Link your MR to any related issue by including the following in the MR description:

     ```plaintext
     Closes #issue-number
     ```

   - This automatically closes the issue when the MR is merged, keeping the issue tracker organized.

7. **Labels for Issues and MRs**
   - Add appropriate labels to your issues and MRs. This helps organize and categorize them,
   making it easier for collaborators to understand their purpose.

8. **Commit Messages and Squash Merging**
   - Since we use squash merging, individual commit messages are not critical.
   Instead, focus on updating the MR title and description, as these will be used for release notes.
   - Squash merging combines all commits into a single commit during merge, simplifying the history.

9. **Roles in Merge Requests**
   - **Assignee**: The person actively working on the MR.
   They are responsible for making changes, addressing feedback, and ensuring the MR meets project standards.
   - **Reviewer**: The person responsible for reviewing the MR, providing feedback, and merging it once it is approved.
   Reviewers generally ignore **Draft** MRs unless explicitly requested by the assignee.

10. **Code Review Guidelines**
    - Reviewers ensure the code adheres to project standards, is thoroughly tested, and does not introduce regressions.
    - They also verify that the MR title and description are clear and complete for release notes.
