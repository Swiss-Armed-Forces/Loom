# Integration tests

The integration tests ensure the functionality of the existing code
by simulating interactions on the entire application.

## Local debugging

It is recommended to debug and create new integration tests in a local
environment where the tests run directly on the machine and communicate with
the application over host mapped ports.

### Prepare the local environment

The integration tests can be executed locally in the development environment.
Use `run-integrationtest` to execute them.
