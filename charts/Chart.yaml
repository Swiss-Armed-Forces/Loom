description: Loom is a powerful and easily deployable open-source document search engine.
# We release the Helm chart and application image together as a single versioned unit.
# Therefore, the chart version and appVersion are always kept identical.
# To avoid duplication, we define the version once and reuse it using YAML anchors.
#
# Bump this version number whenever you make changes to:
# - the application code (new image release),
# - the Helm chart templates,
# - configuration defaults (values.yaml),
# - or any other chart metadata.
#
# This version must follow Semantic Versioning (https://semver.org/).
