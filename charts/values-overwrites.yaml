# This file is intentionally left empty to allow users to easily override Helm values
# when deploying with Skaffold.
#
# Skaffold does not provide a command-line option to override Helm values directly.
# Instead, you can add your custom value overrides here, and they will be automatically
# applied during deployment as this file is included in the valuesFiles list in skaffold.yaml.
#
# Example usage:
#   api:
#     replicas: 3
#   frontend:
#     image:
#       tag: custom-tag
#
# Any values specified here will take precedence over the default values.yaml file.
