# Loom Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open, welcoming, inclusive, and healthy community, we as contributors
and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity
and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to creating an environment where diverse ideas can be shared respectfully, and
collaboration can flourish.

## Our Standards

We aim for a positive and constructive community atmosphere. Examples of behavior that contributes to
creating this positive environment include:

* **Using welcoming and inclusive language:** Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences.
* **Being respectful of differing opinions:** Even when disagreements occur, conduct discussions politely.
Focus on the technical merits and community goals.
* **Giving and gracefully accepting constructive criticism:** Feedback is vital for improvement.
Offer it thoughtfully and be open to receiving it.
* **Focusing on what is best for the community:** Strive for decisions and contributions that benefit the
project and its users as a whole.
* **Showing empathy towards other community members:** Understand that contributors come from diverse
backgrounds and may have different perspectives or constraints.
* **Being open to ideas:** Encourage the sharing of suggestions and improvements, fostering innovation.
* **Communicating factually and avoiding aggression:** Base arguments on evidence and maintain a calm,
professional demeanor. Avoid personal attacks or inflammatory language.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit
permission (doxing).
* Aggressive, intimidating, or hostile communication.
* Spreading misinformation or non-factual claims deliberately.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting or
open-source community.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers (roles assigned by VBS-CY-CEA) are responsible for clarifying the standards of
acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to
any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki
edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily
or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful. Maintainers will strive to apply these principles consistently and fairly.

While maintainers hold the final decision regarding code merges (as outlined in the community concept),
this Code of Conduct applies equally to *all* participants, including maintainers, in all community interactions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (including the GitLab repository, issue tracker,
pull requests, and any future communication channels established for the project) and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or
community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account,
or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of the project may
be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior should be reported by creating an issue
in the Loom GitLab repository's issue tracker: [https://gitlab.com/swiss-armed-forces/cyber-command/cea/loom/-/issues](https://gitlab.com/swiss-armed-forces/cyber-command/cea/loom/-/issues).

**When creating the issue, you have the option to mark it as confidential.** Making an issue confidential
restricts its visibility primarily to project maintainers, ensuring privacy for sensitive reports. Please
use this option if you are concerned about broader visibility of your report.

All reports, whether submitted as public or confidential issues, will be reviewed and investigated promptly
and fairly by the maintainers. The project team is obligated to respect the confidentiality of the reporter
of an incident, particularly when a report is made via a confidential issue. Further details of specific
enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary
or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership (VBS-CY-CEA).

We encourage all participants to help us create a welcoming and positive environment. We value your
