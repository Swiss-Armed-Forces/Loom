* `skaffold` (>= [v2.12.0](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/))

**Installation Steps:**

    git clone https://gitlab.com/swiss-armed-forces/cyber-command/cea/loom.git
    cd loom
    ```

    ```

**Note:** After the build process is complete, open your web browser and navigate to [http://frontend.loom](http://frontend.loom).

## üöÄ Getting Started

This section provides a few quick examples to get you started with Loom. For more detailed
instructions, please refer to the full [Getting Started Guide](Documentation/getting-started.md).

**Indexing Your Data:**

To index your data, use the simple file upload feature available directly in the Loom frontend:

1. **Open the Loom Frontend:** Navigate to [http://frontend.loom](http://frontend.loom)
in your web browser.
2. **Upload Files:** Look for the "Upload" option in the user interface (typically in a
sidebar or as a button). Click on it to open a file selection dialog.
3. **Select Files:** Choose the files you want to index and click "Open" or the equivalent button.
4. **Automatic Processing:** Once the files are selected and uploaded through the frontend,
Loom will automatically process them.

**Searching for a File:**

Use the query box at the top to search for your documents. For example:

* To search for a specific PDF file, try: `filename:"your_document.pdf"`
* To find documents containing the phrase "important information", use: `"important information"`
* To search for documents tagged as "project-report", try: `tags:project-report`

**Viewing Raw JSON:**

To see the raw indexed data of a file:

1. Search for the file.
2. Select it from the search results.
3. Click on the "View content" button.
4. Navigate to the "RAW" tab to see the underlying JSON structure.

**Tagging Files:**

You can tag files individually from the file details view (click the tag icon near the filename)
or use the "Add tag" functionality in the left sidebar to tag multiple files.

**Querying by File Extension:**

To find files of a specific type, use the `extension:.` syntax. For example:

* To find all PDF files: `extension:.pdf`
* To find all text files: `extension:.txt`

## üîç Search Capabilities

Loom offers a flexible and intuitive search experience with the following options:

* **Fuzzy Search:** Find terms even with minor typos using the tilde operator followed
by the maximum edit distance (e.g., `term~2`).
* **Phrase Search:** Search for exact sequences of words by enclosing them in double
quotes (e.g., `"exact phrase"`).
* **Metadata Filtering:** Narrow down your search results by specifying metadata fields
and their values. Supported fields include:
  * `author:name` (e.g., `author:John Doe`)
  * `filename:*.pdf` (e.g., `filename:report*.pdf`)
  * `when:lastweek` (Supports various date/time formats and relative terms)
  * `size>1M` (Supports size comparisons using units like `K`, `M`, `G`)
  * `tags:important` (Search for documents tagged with "important")

## üìö Content Extraction

Loom is designed to efficiently extract both text content and valuable metadata from a wide
range of file types:

* **Archives:** ZIP archives and Mail archives (PST).
* **MS Office:** Documents created with Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Visio, and Publisher.
* **PDF:** Including full Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from scanned
documents and images within PDFs.
* **Images:** Performs OCR to extract text content from various image formats.
* **Emails:** Processes EML message files, including the content of attachments.
* **Other Formats:** Supports OpenOffice documents, Rich Text Format (RTF), Plain Text files,
HTML, XHTML, and many other common document formats.

Loom is engineered to handle **large files** effectively by utilizing multi-threaded processing,
ensuring efficient indexing without excessive resource consumption.
