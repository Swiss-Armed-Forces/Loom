### Uploading a File with French Content

To upload a file with French content:

1. Download a PDF from the internet or find one online.
2. Use the Frontend's upload functionality or place the file in the `intake/` folder.
3. The crawler will monitor this folder and upload any new files.

Alternatively, you can use Loom to upload the file:

1. Open Loom and choose the "Upload" option.
2. Double-click on the option to open a file explorer.
3. Select the desired file and it will remain as a volume in the container unless removed explicitly.

### Searching for a File

To search for a file with French content:

1. Use the query box and input the filename, e.g., `"filename:larvolution00madeuoft.pdf"` (Note: using just the filename without quotes will output an error).
2. Alternatively, you can search by typing a keyword in the file name.
3. If there are multiple files with similar names, use the `*` wildcard to find the specific file.

### Displaying RAW JSON for Indexed Files

To display the RAW JSON for indexed files:

1. Search for the file and select it from the results list.
2. Click on the "View content" button.
3. Select the "RAW" tab to view the raw JSON data, including file metadata and contents.

Tips:

- You can disable line wrapping in the RAW JSON viewer by clicking the options icon (top right corner of the modal).
- If you have multiple files with similar names, use the `*` wildcard to find the specific file.
- The RAW JSON viewer displays the actual file content, including hiddenness, tasks associated, and bytes.

By following these steps, you should be able to upload a file with French content, search for it, and display its RAW JSON data using Loom.

### Tagging Files

Tagging is done by clicking the tag button in the details view or using the tagging functionality from the left-hand side menu. To mass-tag many files, follow these steps:

1. Click on the tag icon near the file name when the file is found.
2. Create or choose a tag for the document.
3. Use the "Add tag" functionality in the left sidebar to add tags individually or in bulk.

### Hiding and Unhiding Files

Hiding and unhiding files can be done by clicking the eye icon. Here's how:

1. Click on the eye icon to hide or unhide a file.
2. Alternatively, use the mass-hide/show files button in the left-hand side menu.
3. Hidden files will disappear from the details view but can be found by clicking on "Hidden Files" or using the query `hidden:true`.

### Querying Files by Suffix

To search for files based on their suffixes, follow these steps:

1. Enter a query in the search bar using the syntax: `extension:.<file_type>`
2. Replace `<file_type>` with the actual file type you are looking for (e.g., `.pdf`, `.txt`, etc.).

Example queries:

- `extension:.pdf` to find all PDF files
- `filename:*.html` to find all HTML files

### Tips and Tricks

- Tags are case-sensitive.
- Hidden files will not affect statistics or search results, but they can be searched specifically using the "Hidden Files" query.
- You can mass-tag multiple files at once using the tagging functionality in the left sidebar.

By following these steps and tips, you should be able to tag, hide, unhide, and query files based on their suffixes using the search bar and file details view. Happy searching!

### Save a query

- Saved queries will be stored in your browser's local cache and can be retrieved by clicking on them in the left sidebar.
- Note: You won't be able to retrieve saved queries from another browser.

### Translate a query to French

- To translate a query, click on the translation indicator (icon) in the search bar and select the language you want to translate to (French).
- Enter your query and search. The translated text will appear in the search results.
- Note: If the translation doesn't appear immediately, try reverting to the previous query.

### Translate the file back to English

- To translate a file from French back to English, click on the translation icon (icon) in the right-side context menu of the file options.
- Click on the "From French" option and select "English". The file will be translated and appear in a new tab.
- Alternatively, you can also use the translation button next to the search bar and select "FR -> EN" to translate the file.
