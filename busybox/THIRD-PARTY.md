While the term “BusyBox” appears as a registered trademark for various goods and services—such as children’s toys and electronic signs—there is no readily apparent trademark specifically registered for the Busybox software itself. Accordingly, the “Busybox” name is used descriptively here, with legal protection resting primarily on copyright law and the GNU General Public License rather than on a registered trademark for software.
